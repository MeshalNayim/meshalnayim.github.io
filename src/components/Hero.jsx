          Iâ€™m Meshal Nayim. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and am now pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at UC San Diego.

Over the past two years, I have built experience through internships and remote work. I have worked as a data analyst, data engineer, and on machine learning and AI solutions.

My work has been mainly in the telecommunications and e-commerce industries, where I built data pipelines, created dashboards, and developed automation and predictive models.

Recently, Iâ€™ve become interested in natural language processing and computer vision, and Iâ€™m exploring how these fields can be applied to healthcare data science.

I enjoy working with data at every level â€” from organizing and understanding it to using advanced models for new insights â€” and Iâ€™m drawn to projects where research and real-world impact meet.
